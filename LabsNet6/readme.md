# Labs

You can find 2 folders: 
- Starter
- Solution

The **Starter** folder contains code that you have to complete.
You're going to find many files with a lot of commented code.
You have to uncomment the code of the excercise you want to try and complete the missing query.
When you are done, you can compare your code to the **Solution** project.
